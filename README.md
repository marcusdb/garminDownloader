# Multiple Downloader

The multiple-file download is a collection of extensions that use the new *download*
attribute in HTML5 to offer multiple-file downloading. Simple as that.

This is not meant to be a "download accelerator," "download manager" or anything like
that. It is meant to work within the browser using the browser's own download
capabilities and features. It simply lets a user quickly choose and download the
content that is marked as downloadable on the page.
This should really be a built-in feature of browsers, since the *download* attribute is
now somewhat standard and defined in HTML5.
